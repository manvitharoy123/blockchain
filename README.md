## 💻Features

- 📍The developed Dapp is meant to be a payroll system with basic functionality implemented on  Ethereum. The key benefit of implementing a payroll system on the blockchain is to reduce the  risk for employees when it comes to getting paid for their work. Traditional payroll systems are characterised by 2 limitations :
	With traditional payroll system, employees are forced to trust that the employer will be  willing and able pay their salary as agreed in the employment contract.
The frequency on payment would also reduce the risk to which  employees are exposed in terms of not getting paid.
- 🗒️The Payroll contract - Contains key logic and access control related to the payroll and also added the function where sender can send the money to the users.
- 🌟The EmployeeContractStorage contract - Used to store all data related to employee  contracts.
- 💬The OneTimeChannel contract - Used to verify hash, signature and value data,paying the employee if successful. Here we have implemented the concept of Digital signature
